# Salina Twitter Bike Bot

[Salina Bike Advisory Twitter Account](https://twitter.com/SalinaBikeBot)

An automated Twitter bot that tweets advice on weather or not to bike southward to work, and northward from work on a given day based on current and predicted weather conditions.

Loosely based on the 20/20 rules, with some additional pieces of information taken into account.
